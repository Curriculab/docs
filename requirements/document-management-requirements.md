- [ ] Each submission requires: document type (selected from a configurable list: Official Transcript, Immunization Record, Proof of Residency, Program Application, Other), issuing institution or authority, and an optional note to the reviewer
- [ ] Upon submission, the student receives a confirmation notification with a unique submission reference number (see [notifications-requirements.md](./notifications-requirements.md))

- [ ] Reviewers can accept, reject (with a required reason), or request additional information for each submitted document
- [ ] Accepting a document updates any linked requirement (e.g., clears an immunization hold — REG-006; advances a transfer credit request — XFER-001)
- [ ] Rejected submissions include a student-facing reason explaining what was wrong and whether resubmission is permitted
- [ ] All review actions are logged with the reviewer's identity and timestamp (AUTH-010)

**I want** to see the current status of every document I have submitted
**So that** I know whether my submission is complete or whether action is needed from me

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] A "My Documents" page lists all submissions with: document type, submission date, reference number, and status (Pending / Under Review / Accepted / Rejected / Additional Information Requested)
- [ ] Clicking a submission shows the full detail: uploaded file preview, reviewer notes (if shared), and the linked requirement it was submitted to fulfill

## DOC-004: Generate and Download Official University Documents

**As a** Student
**I want** to generate official documents issued by the university
**So that** I can provide proof of enrollment, academic standing, or other official information to third parties

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Students can generate the following official documents on demand: Enrollment Verification Letter (PROF-006), Unofficial Transcript (REC-003), and GPA/Good Standing Letter
- [ ] Each generated document is produced as a tamper-evident PDF including: a unique document ID, generation timestamp, and a verification URL that third parties can use to confirm authenticity
- [ ] Generation is blocked if the student has an active financial or administrative hold that restricts record access (REG-006)
- [ ] Administrators can generate official university documents on behalf of any student
- [ ] A log of all generated documents (type, date, generated by) is retained on the student's record and accessible to Administrators

## DOC-005: Configure Document Types and Retention Rules

**As an** Administrator
**I want** to configure which document types the system accepts and how long they are retained
**So that** the system meets institutional policy and legal data retention requirements

### Acceptance Criteria
- [ ] Administrators can create, edit, and deactivate document types with: type name, description, allowed file formats, maximum file size, which staff roles can review it, and whether student resubmission is allowed after rejection
- [ ] Each document type has a configurable retention period (in years); documents past their retention date are flagged for deletion review (SEC-005)
- [ ] Deactivating a document type prevents new submissions of that type but preserves all existing submissions and their history
- [ ] Retention policy changes apply only to documents submitted after the change takes effect; existing documents are governed by the retention period in effect at submission time
- [ ] Administrators receive a monthly report listing documents approaching or past their retention date, pending their deletion decision
